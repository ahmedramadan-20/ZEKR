feat: Settings refactoring and complete theme system

# Settings Screen Refactoring (130 lines removed)
- Created reusable gradient card widgets:
  - SettingCard (interactive gradient card)
  - SettingSwitchCard (gradient card with switch)
  - SettingInfoCard (non-interactive gradient card)
- Refactored settings_screen.dart from 565 to 435 lines (23% reduction)
- Removed 3 inline builder methods
- Applied beautiful gradient styling matching home screen
- All settings cards now use consistent gradient design

# Complete Dark/Light Theme System
- Implemented full theme management with BLoC pattern:
  - theme_state.dart (Freezed state: light/dark)
  - theme_cubit.dart (theme switching logic)
  - Theme persistence via SharedPreferences
- Updated app_theme.dart with complete ThemeData:
  - AppTheme.lightTheme (full light theme configuration)
  - AppTheme.darkTheme (full dark theme configuration)
- Added dark theme colors to app_colors.dart:
  - darkBackground (#0F1419)
  - darkSurface (#1A1D3D)
  - darkCardBackground, darkTextPrimary, darkTextSecondary
- Integrated theme system into app.dart:
  - BlocProvider<ThemeCubit> at app root
  - BlocBuilder for reactive theme switching
  - theme, darkTheme, and themeMode configuration
- Registered ThemeCubit in dependency_injection.dart
- Fixed SharedPrefHelper file corruption:
  - Completely rewrote from 489 → 303 clean lines
  - Added getIsDarkMode() and setIsDarkMode() methods
  - All original methods preserved

# Settings UI Updates
- Added "المظهر" (Appearance) section as first section
- Dark mode toggle ("الوضع الليلي") with purple gradient
- All setting cards now use gradient colors:
  - Reading settings: Primary + Secondary colors
  - Data management: Juz badge + Error colors
  - App info: Accent + Yellow colors
- Theme-aware text colors for dark mode support
